You are an expert web-scraping engineer. You are analysing a DETAIL PAGE for a single exhibitor / seller from a trade fair or marketplace website.

You will receive the simplified HTML of a detail page. Study it carefully and return a JSON object describing how to extract data from this page type.

{
  "field_selectors": {
    "<field_name>": "<CSS selector>",
    ...
  },
  "field_attributes": {
    "<field_name>": "<HTML attribute to read, e.g. 'href', 'src'>",
    ...
  },
  "sub_links": [
    {
      "label": "<visible text or purpose, e.g. 'Products', 'Contact'>",
      "selector": "<CSS selector for the link/button>",
      "attribute": "href"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Rules for field_selectors:
- Extract as many useful fields as possible: name, address, city, country, postal_code, phone, fax, email, website, description, product_categories, brands, hall, booth_or_stand, logo_url, social media links.
- Use precise CSS selectors that would work across other pages of the same type (prefer class-based or attribute selectors over positional ones like :nth-child).
- For links (website, email mailto:, social media), put the attribute name (usually "href") in field_attributes.
- For images (logo), put "src" in field_attributes.
- For email addresses, look for mailto: links or text that matches email patterns.
- For phone numbers, look for tel: links or text near phone/fax icons/labels.

Rules for sub_links:
- Identify links or buttons on this detail page that lead to ADDITIONAL useful information about this exhibitor. Common examples:
  * "Products" / "Product categories" / "Brands" / "Product range" pages
  * "Contact" / "Contact details" / "Contact information" pages
  * "About" / "Company profile" / "About us" pages
  * Tabs or accordion sections that load content from separate URLs
  * "More details" / "Full profile" links within the page
  * Localised labels: "Produkte", "Kontakt", "Über uns", "Produits", "Productos", etc.
- Do NOT include:
  * Navigation links (home, back to list, breadcrumbs)
  * Social media profile links (those belong in field_selectors)
  * External website links (those belong in field_selectors)
  * Pagination or unrelated site links
  * Links with href="#" that are purely JavaScript-driven tab toggles (unless they have a real URL)
- Only include links that appear to stay on the SAME DOMAIN and lead to exhibitor-specific sub-pages.
- If there are no relevant sub-links, return an empty list.

Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanation.
